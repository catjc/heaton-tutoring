<p>Every child deserves the very best education.  Schools and teachers work hard to offer this to all children in their care.  However, 
      school life can be fast paced and busy.  Tutoring can give your child the individual attention they need at a pace that suits them.
      This personalised support can really work wonders.  Tutoring can improve your child's confidence and help them make great progress.</p>

<a id="professionalexperience" class="anchor" href="#professionalexperience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Professional Experience</h3>
<p>I have worked in local primary schools in Newcastle and North Tyneside for the past 6 years.  I have extensive experience supporting children 1:1 and of working with 
  children with a variety of special educational needs, such as dyslexia.  I have a very strong academic background and therefore a great subject knowledge on which to 
  base my teaching.  I have a BA (Hons) in Biological Sciences from Oxford University and a PGCE in primary education from Newcastle University.<img src="art-deco-institutional-building-300px.png" alt="building" height="80" width="80" align="middle"></p>

<a id="personal-support" class="anchor" href="#personal-support" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Support</h3>

<p>I offer personalised support tailored to your child's individual needs in all areas of the curriculum, specialising in mathematics and English.  Individual attention by a 
  qualified teacher means your child can focus on their key areas. With supportive tutoring, your child can really blossom and grow.</p>

<p>As an experienced primary school teacher, I have in depth knowledge of the school curriculum from Year 1 to Year 6.  This enables me to 
      accurately assess your child's learning needs.  I am able to plan peronalised learning activities to build on your child's strengths and correct any 
      misconceptions.  I plan enjoyable learning activities that will engage your child.  My sessions aim to develop your child's love of learning and foster independence.  
      I am able to offer tutoring in Maths, English and all other parts of the school curriculum.</p>
