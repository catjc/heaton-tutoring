<p>I have worked in local primary schools in Newcastle and North Tyneside for the past 6 years.  I have extensive experience supporting children 1:1 and of working with 
  children with a variety of special educational needs, such as dyslexia.  I have a very strong academic background and therefore a great subject knowledge on which to 
  based my teaching.  I completed the PGCE in primary education at Newcastle University.  I gained a BA (Hons) in Biological Sciences from Oxford University as an undergraduate.</p>

<a id="personal-support" class="anchor" href="#personal-support" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Support</h3>

<p>I offer personalised support tailored to your child's individual needs in all areas of the curriculum, specialising in mathematics and English.  Individual attention by a 
  qualified teacher means your child can focus on their key areas. With supportive tutoring, your child can really blossom and grow.</p>
